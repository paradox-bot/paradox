Hi {user.mention}!

I am a high quality LaTeX rendering and utility bot created to enhance mathematical discussion.

__**LaTeX**__
Unless LaTeX recognition has been disabled for a server, I will recognise and render any LaTeX you type automatically.
I reply to your message with the rendered output, and add `delete`, `show source/error`, `delete source` reactions.
If any LaTeX errors have occured, I will display what output is possible (with automatic error correction), along with the errors.

Commands:
```
{prefix}config latex enable/disable -- Enable or disable latex recognition for this server.
{prefix}tex -- Manually render tex, and change your compile or display options.
{prefix}preamble -- Change your personal preamble (Define custom commands and add packages here!)
{prefix}help tex -- See examples of use and all the options available!
```

__**Utility**__
Some of the utility features available:
```
{prefix}ask -- Query the Wolfram Alpha computational engine!
{prefix}nlab -- Search the ncatlab
{prefix}calc -- Basic calculator
{prefix}time -- Display your own time or that of another user (after setting your timezone)
{prefix}notifyme -- Tells you when a message mentions you or matches other conditions
```

There are heaps more features (including an entire suite of advanced moderation tools), but they won't fit into this message! 
Plus, we are always growing and expanding, improving our features or adding new ones!

Use `{prefix}list` to see all my commands and `{prefix}help cmd` to get detailed help for `cmd`.
If you still have any questions, requests, comments, or other feedback, please let us know with the `{prefix}feedback` command or join our friendly support server at {support}

You can invite me at {invite}. Also, if you really like me and would like to help keep me going, I greatly appreciate donations at <{donate}>.
